myCorpCongressman
=================

A work in progress web app which will show users their info on their congressmen/women, in particular info regarding their campaign contributions


How to set this up:

You will need the following software to begin deploying this code:
1. node.js + NPM
2. MongoDB
3. Ruby/SASS

In order to install the all the node modules, run 
  npm install --save

Then install all the bower components with:
  bower install --save
  
Finally, assuming I haven't left anything out (if I have, you will most likely be prompted by npm and it should be self explanatory how to get it installed), you can deploy using the command: 
  grunt serve
  
I would suggest looking into DaftMonk's angular-fullstack git page, as it describes all the dependencies for using projects based off of that and how to do various deploys, such as production deploys and heroku deploys.
